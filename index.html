      <p>A business is made up of many different systems: marketing, accounting, logistics, manufacturing and so on. Information systems are an important part of any business. It is the glue that interconnects all the systems.
        Business continuity management is a holistic management process that identifies potential threats to an organisation’s systems and ensures the provision of processes and procedures to minimise their impact on business continuance.
        A Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP) is an important part of business continuity management. It is an action plan that charts the procedures for recovering critical business functions after a catastrophe – an event resulting in great loss or misfortune.
        The goal of a DRP is to recover critical business systems as soon as possible to a minimal functioning order.

      <h2>Our Values</h2><br>
      <h4><strong>Cybersecurity Workplace Culture</strong> </br>A cybersecurity workplace culture is a culture where security is ingrained and infused in every aspect of the workplace. It is built into the thinking and planning. It is included in the application, systems and processes. It is a part and parcel of how work is done. Thereby, minimising the chances of a cyber-attack. A strong cybersecurity posture is heavily reliant on an organisation’s culture. Building a cybersecurity workplace culture not only emphasises and reinforces security behaviours among staff but it also helps to protect your organisation against a cyber-attack.</h4><br>
      <p><strong>Designing and building cybersecurity workplace culture</strong> </br> 
        Establishing a cybersecurity workplace culture, while widely considered to be a tough mission to accomplish, is not as daunting as you may think.
        Consider a few elements, the first of which is the attitude. The attitude towards cybersecurity, including how the management implements cybersecurity while ensuring educational and communication plans are in place; all contribute to successfully building a cybersecurity workplace culture:

                Recovery procedures are put in place to ensure that the system can be quickly restored after the event occurs. For example, the use of a hot-site (one that has a computer system already set up and ready to use) allows for speedy recovery after a fire has gutted the building. This process may also be termed a contingency. In fact DRP is sometimes referred to as contingency planning.
    
                <br />
                In order to recover from a disaster it is important that staff complete regular recovery and operational procedures.

              <div class="panel-body">
                There are many options available to prevent risk from occurring. Some of these are based on policies or standards and may involve no additional cost. However, some options, such as a hot site, can be very expensive.
                <br/>When deciding which options to adopt, you need to weigh the possible cost of the risk event against the cost of the recovery or prevention option (single incident cost). A simple formula can be used to calculate how much money to allocate to a recovery or prevention measure for the known value of an asset.
                <br/>Loss= Single Incident Cost X Rate of Threat Occurrence
                <br/>While a typical small business can still suffer a relatively large loss in the case of critical system failure, it will probably not choose to create a backup site because of the high cost.

                •	&nbsp;Latency: The cloud can have latency, especially if many users are trying to access the same data or cloud or if an organization is trying to get a large volume of data out of the cloud. This is where a retention policy becomes key; when backed-up data keeps growing, it can become hard to keep a handle on it all, which can delay recovery time.<br />
                •	&nbsp;Security issues: Some organizations are still worried about the safety of keeping data in the cloud. Confirm that a cloud backup product has the necessary security elements, such as end-to-end encryption. In addition, just because a backup is in the cloud, that doesn't mean it's safe from cyber attacks, so be wary of a false sense of security.<br />
                •	&nbsp;Slow, costly restores. Restoring data out of the cloud can be a time-consuming and costly process, especially when it involves large volumes. Data egress fees can quickly make restorations expensive.

    <h2>Cybersecurity</h2>
    <p>
      Referred to as information security, cybersecurity refers to the practice of ensuring the integrity, confidentiality, 
      and availability (ICA) of information. Cybersecurity is comprised of an evolving set of tools, risk management approaches, 
      technologies, training, and best practices designed to protect networks, devices, programs, and data from attacks or unauthorized access.

        <div id="collapse1" class="panel-collapse collapse">
          <div class="panel-body">The world relies on technology more than ever before. As a result, digital data creation has surged. Today, businesses and governments store a great deal of that data on computers and transmit it across networks to other computers. Devices and their underlying systems have vulnerabilities that, when exploited, undermine the health and objectives of an organization.
            A data breach can have a range of devastating consequences for any business. It can unravel a company’s reputation through the loss of consumer and partner trust. The loss of critical data, such as source files or intellectual property, can cost a company its competitive advantage. Going further, a data breach can impact corporate revenues due to non-compliance with data protection regulations. It’s estimated that, on average, a data breach costs an affected organization $3.6 million. With high-profile data breaches making media headlines, it’s essential that organizations adopt and implement a strong cybersecurity approach.

                    Social engineering is a type of manipulation that coaxes someone into giving up confidential information such as a social security number or building access codes. Social engineering, in the world of information security, is a type of cyber-attack that works to get the better of people through trickery and deception rather than technological exploits. These attacks take advantage of human vulnerabilities such as emotions, trust or habit in order to convince individuals to take action such as clicking a fraudulent link or visiting a malicious website. Though less sophisticated than other cyber-attack strategies, social engineering can have severe consequences and often can be the attacker's foot in the door for a major attack.

  <h2>Data Breach</h2>
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    A data breach is a security incident in which information is accessed without authorization. 
    Data breaches can hurt businesses and consumers in a variety of ways. 
    They are a costly expense that can damage lives and reputations and take time to repair.   
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    As technology progresses, more and more of our information has been moving to the digital world. 
    As a result, cyberattacks have become increasingly common and costly.
    We’ve created a 7-step checklist to use in the case of a data breach. Depending on the severity of the breach and the information exposed, 
    you’ll need to apply some or all of these steps to varying degree.  <b>Seven Step Checklist</b>
  </p> 
  <ul class="nav nav-tabs">
    <li class="active"><a data-toggle="tab" href="#home">1. Confirm the breach if your information was exposed</a></li>
    <li><a data-toggle="tab" href="#menu1">2. Find out what type of data was stolen</a></li>
    <li><a data-toggle="tab" href="#menu2">3. Accept the breached company's offer(s) to help</a></li>
    <li><a data-toggle="tab" href="#menu3">4. Strengthen your online logins, passwords and security</a></li>
    <li><a data-toggle="tab" href="#menu4">5. Contact the right people and take additional action</a></li>
    <li><a data-toggle="tab" href="#menu5">6. Stay alert; monitor your accounts closely</a></li>

  </ul>
  <div class="tab-content" style="background-color: #eee; padding: 40px; height: 300px;">
    <div id="home" class="tab-pane fade in active">
      <h3>Confirm the breach and if your information was exposed</h3>
      <p>
        The first step is to confirm that a breach actually occurred. 
        When a data breach occurs, scammers may reach out to you posing as the breached company to try to obtain more of your personal information. Don't fall for fake emails. Go to the company's secure website and/or 
        call the company to confirm the breach and whether your information was involved.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="menu1" class="tab-pane fade">
      <h3>Find out what type of data was stolen</h3>
      <p>
        Why does the type of information exposed matter? 
        While stolen credit cards and the like can be cancelled and replaced, it's quite difficult to obtain a new Social Security number. And fraudsters can do a lot more with your SSN and other unique, 
        sensitive PII than they can accomplish with an email or credit card account.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="menu2" class="tab-pane fade">
      <h3>Accept the breached company's offer(s) to help</h3>
      <p>
        If the breached company offers to help repair the damage and protect you for a certain amount of time, unless there have been issues with their offer, take them up on it.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id="menu3" class="tab-pane fade">
      <h3>Change Password and Security Q&A</h3>
      <p>
        It's important to immediately change your online login information, passwords, and security questions-and-answers for the breached account(s)—along with your other accounts if they have similar passwords and security Q&A—to limit the reach of the hackers' arms. This step was especially important for victims with stolen email accounts.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id="menu4" class="tab-pane fade">
      <h3>Contact the right people to tack action</h3>
      <p>This is where the type of data stolen really comes into play. 
        If your credit and/or debit card information was stolen, you should reach out immediately to the financial institution(s) to cancel your card and request a new one. However, if personal information like your Social Security number was stolen, 
        it may be easier for you to become a victim of identity theft.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="menu5" class="tab-pane fade">
        <h3>Stay alert; monitor your accounts closely</h3>
        <p>
            It's important to watch for signs of new activity. In cases where Social Security numbers were stolen, the hackers and others who put their hands on the numbers may use them now or wait years when victims may be less suspecting. Follow the breach-related steps noted above when your Social Security number is exposed.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="menu6" class="tab-pane fade">
        <h3>File your taxes early</h3>
        <p>In US, if your Social Security number has been stolen or you just want to take precautionary measures, you may be able to beat fraudsters to the IRS, making it less likely they'll commit tax-refund identity theft.</p>

  <h2>Project Teams</h2>
  <p>A project team can be defined as a number of people who work closely together to achieve shared common goals. Through interaction and collaboration, the team strives to enhance its creativity, innovation, problem solving, decision making, support and work performance.
    From the definitions, a team implies a number of people working together to achieve results, while a group of people (in project management speak) implies a collection of individuals who, although they might be working on the same project, do not necessarily interact with each other. This is often the case when the project manager coordinates the project with the people individually. Under such conditions, unity of project purpose is a myth.</p>
